## Introduction
The GISP-Cam system is built with commercially available electronic components, avoiding proprietary software and hardware
requirements. 

### Motivation
The Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) was a multinational ice core drilling project in Greenland located at the summit
of the Greenland ice sheet. The project was conducted in the early 1990s and retrieved over 3000 meters of ice core.
The site of the GISP2 camp is now the location of the National Science Foundation's Summit Station. Summit Station is
now a year-round research station which hosts two different two different neutrino detector experiments which are 
deployed in the ice sheet, the Radio Neutrino Observatory (RNO-G) and the Radar Echo Telescope (RET). The GISP2 borehole
site is still accessible though the upper casing has degraded such that access to equipment and large cameras is no longer
possible beyond about 60 feet down due to casing deformation. The state of the casing beyond this and the lower borehole
section is largely unknown.
<br>
The GISP-Cam system is being developed to investigate the state of the borehole casing above and below the 60 foot 
deformation.
